AI-Powered NASDAQ Analyzer [OpenAI]

---

This project uses the OpenAI API to classify companies from the **Nasdaq-100** into sectors.  
We focus only on companies that are **headquartered in California**.

We also use price change data to see how each company and sector performed during this year.

2. Add a new column `sector` to the company data.

3. Analyze **how well each sector performed** this year (based on 1-year price change).
